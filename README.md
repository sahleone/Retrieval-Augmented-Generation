# README: Preparing Data from Wikipedia and Storing it in LanceDB for Retrieval Augmented Generation

## Introduction
This Python notebook provides a guide to preparing data extracted from Wikipedia and storing it in LanceDB for Retrieval Augmented Generation. The process outlined here is for enhancing the capabilities of large language models using the OpenAI API with more up to daate data from Wikipedia.

## Overview
1. **Data Extraction from Wikipedia**: We start by extracting relevant data from Wikipedia articles using various methods such as web scraping or utilizing Wikipedia's API. This data extraction process ensures that we gather a diverse range of information that can be used to augment language models effectively.

2. **Data Preprocessing**: Once the data is extracted, we preprocess it to ensure uniformity and consistency. This may involve tasks such as cleaning the text, removing irrelevant information, and organizing the data into structured formats suitable for storage in LanceDB.

3. **Storing Data in LanceDB**: LanceDB is utilized as the database management system to store the preprocessed Wikipedia data. We design a schema that accommodates the specific requirements of our data and ensure efficient storage and retrieval mechanisms.

4. **Integration with OpenAI API**: After storing the data in LanceDB, we integrate it with the OpenAI API for language model augmentation. This involves making API calls to the OpenAI service, passing in the formatted data as input, and receiving augmented responses that enhance the language model's capabilities.
